## Features

- This is a simple extension to allow the users to get a webpage with the particles animation on it. The users can then edit the web page to include the content they require for their own project.

- Implement 4 different animations using the input field of your vs-code. Each command would provide you different files that can eaisly be changed to improve the animations.

- Implement a styling sheet for your project that comes with styling options for almost all the components you would need in your project.

## Animation

Make sure you are inside your project folder before running the commands. The following commands would also overwite the files if they have the same name.

- Currently, by installing the extension and then typing "Create TypeParticles" would provide you with 5 different files. This would allow you to start with the particles.js animation and typewriter animation without cloning any repository. The files created are: index.html, particles.js, app.js, style.css and typewrite.js. The animations use [particle.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) and [typewrite.js](https://ola-wale.github.io/typewritejs/)

- "Create Particles" allows you to implement just the particles.js animation in your project. The files created are: index.html, particles.js, app.js and style.css. The animation uses [particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/)

- "Create Type" allows you to implement just the typewriter.js animation in your project. The files created are: index.html, style.css and typewrite.js. The animation uses [typewrite.js](https://ola-wale.github.io/typewritejs/)

- "Create Anime" allows you to implement just the Anime.js animation in your project. The files created are: index.html, style.css and animation.js. The animation uses [anime.js](https://animejs.com)

- "Create Global Styling" would allow you to get a new file with the stylesheet and the instructions about loading the file in your project. An input box will pop up and name the file (without ".css") where you want the new css stylesheet to be. A new file is created if the file doesn't exist

- "Create Text Animations" allows the user to get different CSS based animations for the text they give. The files created are: index.html and styles.css. The animations use [animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css)
