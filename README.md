## Features

This is a simple extension to allow the users to get a webpage with the particles animation on it. The users can then edit the web page to include the content they require for their own project.

## Animation

Currently, by installing the extension and then typing "Create App" would provide you with 4 different files. This would allow you to start with the particles.js animation without cloning any repository. Make sure you are inside your project folder before running the command.
